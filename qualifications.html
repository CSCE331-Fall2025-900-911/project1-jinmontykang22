                        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
                        <p>In terms of languages, I am more confident in Java, Python, and C++. I also know HTML/CSS, Javascript, and R. I am able to use Git.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, I have experience in modeling using <a href= "https://www.simio.com/">SIMIO</a>, a simulation software used to model real-world processes through object-oriented, 3D discrete-event simulation. In my case, I modeled various airport operations, like security screening checkpoints (SSCP) and passenger movements in a terminal. I am experienced in another internal simulation software used to generate flight gating schedules. </p>

                        <h3>Technical Interests</h3>
                        <p>My main interest is the combination of computer science with statistics/data science. I enjoy optimizing processes, and utilizing data to identify inefficiency and potential areas of improvement can only be supported by data. The value of data relies on the ability to analyze and interpret it. I believe that computer science and statistics synergize well. </p>
                        <p>In terms of AI, I am interested in its application to optimization and data collection. Working in a project that was based on computer vision led me to research real-world applications of this technology, such as <a href="https://www.matroid.com/">Matroid</a> or <a href="https://viso.ai/">Viso AI</a>. For example, London Heathrow airport has implemented computer vision systems to improve the efficiency of their baggage handling. Many airports have begun to utilize computer vision to optimize various processes.</p> 
                        <p>It enables systems to interpret and act on visual input through object detection and tracking. In aviation, it can affect security screening (CLEAR check-in), baggage handling, passenger flow monitoring, and aircraft/runway inspection. Although my experience is centered around the aviation industry, computer vision is widely applicable and can improve many other industries. </p>
