            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a junior CS major with an emphasis in statistics at Texas A&M. I study computer science because of the creative possibilities within coding. Between middle and high school, I first got into coding with extremely rudimentary game development. To bypass district restrictions, I made games with my friends using low level languages to entertain ourselves. What I valued most about my experience back then was the collaborative aspect of coding, brainstorming, and testing the games. In high school, the computer science courses introduced me to computer science. Learning was supplemented mainly with "puzzle" like coding challenges, which I found engaging. I enjoyed working through the puzzles. I wanted to create something. My first language was Java, and I used it to create my first "actual" game. Another aspect of computer science that I appreciate is its vastness in both width and depth. There are numerous areas of interest and study under the umbrella of CS, and these paths aren't necessarily shallow either. During my first internship, I worked under an experienced mentor to create a computer vision-based proof of concept. Computer vision was much more deep than I expected, involving learning models (CNN, RNN, etc.), data annotations, physical sensors, and various techniques. Being a part of this seemingly complex, "black box-esque" project with guidance was an extremely valuable experience. </p>
            <p>I am the oldest of three total brothers. My relationship with them isn't antagonistic; I always cherish the time I spend with them. When I'm with them on breaks, we often go bowling. Bowling is one of my hobbies, ever since middle school. I think that my commitment to bowling has taught me the value of consistency and active participation. I can't expect to improve if I don't make the effort to go out and bowl often. This summer, I'm proud to say that I finally broke the 200 point milestone (although my brother quickly overtook me again). I also enjoy listening to music and reading. My love for music likely stems from my active participation in orchestra during middle and high school. I had a wonderful time playing with other members of the orchestra. Reading is an even older hobby. It allows me to explore other people's thoughts and worlds. Through reading, I believe I have cultivated my curiosity and empathy. </p>
