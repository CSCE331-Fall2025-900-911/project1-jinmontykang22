                <p>I'm Monty</p>
                <p>a CS student at A&M.</p>
                <p>Nice to meet you.</p>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I'm Monty, a junior CS student at Texas A&M. I first decided on pursuing computer science in high school, after taking the computer science courses available to me. I enjoyed working through the "puzzles" and challenges present in coding. Additionally, in middle and high school, I made a few games to play with my friends, due to the school heavily restricting games for a while. I think that the process of creating these tiny projects to bring others joy was another deciding factor in choosing this major. I wanted to create something. Working with others in a more professional setting set my expectations more realistically. I am aware of so much more possibilities in coding, but what's expected in the workplace is clearly a far cry from my original motivations. Still, I enjoyed learning new things, such as computer vision. The process of training the AI to recognize distances and people (involving a long time spent holding a chessboard up to a camera) was very enjoyable. The process of developing a proof of concept, essentially an experimental product, was engaging and reminded me of those tiny projects I did as a middle schooler. The process of building, testing, and seeing the system improve in real time was a valuable experience for me.</p>
                <p>I am the oldest of three total brothers. I like to think that I am the one who sets an example, the one to look up to. However, I don't want to become too distant from my brothers. I always cherish the time I get to spend with them, like going to the pool or bowling. Bowling especially is a passion of mine. It's a way to connect with my brothers and father. My father first introduced it to us, and ever since then, all three of us continue bowling to this day. Bowling is a bridge I use to bond with my family. It's a reminder that the time and effort I put in can show results.</p>
