                        <h3>The 12th Can</h3>
                        <p>Currently, I have been a member of <a href= "https://12thcan.tamu.edu/">The 12th Can</a> for 2 years. This is a student-led food pantry available to students, faculty, and staff. Their mission to eliminate hunger at A&M and raise awareness on food insecurity on campuses is a message I highly value.</p>
                        <p>This is an opportunity for me to contribute to the community and help support an organization that positively impacts others' lives. I get to work for a cause that I can wholeheartedly agree with. Most of my work is during pantry openings and performing other simple tasks. Even the mundane work helps keep things running, so I'm content with what I do.</p>

                        <h3>Library Volunteering</h3>
                        <p>Back in high school, I was a teen volunteer at my <a href="https://library.cityoflewisville.com/home">local library</a>. I made good use of the library's services many times, so working there felt natural. Most of my work was done in the Children's Wing: shelving and participating in on-hands community events.</p>
                        <p>Now that I'm in college, I am clearly ineligible for the teen volunteering program. I think it would be worthwhile asking how I can contribute to the library in a different way.</p>

                        <h3>Mentoring</h3>
                        <p>I'm not sure how useful my knowledge would be to others, but I remember not having a clear idea on anything about the future when I was a high schooler. It could be worth writing down what I've learned and making it a simple resource. </p>
