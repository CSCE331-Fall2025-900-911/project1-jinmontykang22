                        <h3>Data Collection App</h3>
                        <p>I assisted in developing an internal, mobile app intended for data collection. The app is capable of recording/saving hundreds of data entries for various airport functions. It was developed primarily using Java in <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a>.</p>

                        <p>I am currently working on a personal website (this website). The goal is to create a professional looking personal website that can later serve as a portfolio for other projects and a way to present myself. It is being developed using HTML, CSS, and JS. </p>

                        <h3>CV Proof of Concept</h3>
                        <p>I assisted in developing a computer vision-based proof of concept as a potential tool for company use. The intent was for the system to be able to monitor areas of interest, collecting statistics such as headcount, speed, and wait time. It was developed using various resources like <a href="https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/">Supervision</a> and <a href="https://www.ultralytics.com/">Ultralytics</a>. The code I worked on was written in mainly Python.</p>
